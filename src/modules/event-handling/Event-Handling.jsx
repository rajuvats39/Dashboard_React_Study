        <p>Event handlers determine what action is to be taken whenever an event is fired. This could be a button click or a change in a text input.</p>
        <p>Essentially, event handlers are what make it possible for users to interact with your React app. Handling events with React elements is similar to handling events on DOM elements, with a few minor exceptions</p>
        <p>If youâ€™re familiar with how events work in standard HTML and JavaScript, it should be easy for you to learn how to handle events in React</p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-primary">onClick Handlers </span></h5>
        <p>The React onClick event handler enables you to call a function and trigger an action when a user clicks an element, such as a button, in your app.</p>
        <p>Event names are written in camelCase, so the onclick event is written as onClick in a React app. In addition, React event handlers appear inside curly braces.</p>
